        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>App Description: Users will go to this site to play games from up-and-coming developers that that want to share their computer games on a platform. anyone who would want to upload a game can do so just by making an account and uploading their .exe, .py, or .jar files to the sever. From there the app would keep track on the amount of likes and plays the game receives. Other users can also follow other developers to see what latest applications and games they have come up with.</p>
        <p>Key Features: Some key features are the ability to see how well oneâ€™s game would do. This gives developers a chance to see how well they have developed something for a company that they may want to work at or get more confidence on choosing this career path.</p>
        <p>Genre: Games and networking because games can be played on the application and networking, so developers get feedback on the games they have created and new ideas on what to make by the vast variety of other games out there.</p>
        <p>User Interface: The user interface would be similar to that of YouTube but instead of it being videos it would be games instead. Once a user logs in, the games that show up on the home screen are based off who the user subscribes to and what genre of games they mostly play.</p>
        <p>Functionality: The app is governed by admins (just me for now being the only admin) and admins would check through the game to make sure there is no Rated R material coming from the game or the game would be taken down. If the game passes the admins check then the game can make it on to the site where everyone in the community can try out the game.</p>
        <p>Personal Statement: I have created applications and games on my own and had no real way that I knew of to share them with others, other than just having then download the game from GitHub after they run it through their compiler or getting a flash drive and having them take it and use if from that so I thought this could be a cool idea if anyone else is having that same idea of not knowing how to share their games.</p>
